* Icons
    + I used some icons from the Font Awesome library. A star highlighting the highscores button. 
* Colours
    + I have used Coolors to help in the selection of my colour scheme.
    #f9dc5cff - This colour will be used as a background colour.
    #ed254eff - This colour will be used as the starting button on the landing page and also the progressbar during the quizgame.
    #000000 - This color will be used on all text.
    #FFFFFF -  This color will only be used to highlight the alternative buttons for the questions.
    #465362ff - This color will be used on the highscore button to separate from the play button.
    #2cd126 - This color will be used on the tabs form in the game.
    #5d0af8 - When clicked the right answer this color will be shown.
